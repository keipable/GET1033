           <h5> <p>As a passionate radio-listener, the radio is a form of traditional media that I enjoy listening to. However, with modernisation and advancements in technology, many argue that the radio is facing its downfall with the number of listeners declining sharply. This saddens me which prompted me to embark on this project. </p>
<p> Firstly, I did a simple survey via Instastory to find out whether people still listened to the radio and their reasons for doing so or for not doing so. There were responses such as “Too much talking” and “No because they don’t play songs I’m into”. To me, these responses depict situations that are temporary and can be avoided. Naturally, the first solution that one can think of to the aforementioned problems is to switch channels. That was when I conceptualised this project which has a player that naturally helps users to switch to their preferred radio stations at different times of the day.</p>

<p> An example of my web radio player function can be seen in following short video. Intially, at 1.34am (seen at the top left corner), I was listening to Chinese radio station 933. While listening, I set the player to switch to 987 at 1.35am. When it was 1.35am, the player automatically changed to 987 seamlessly.  </p>

<p>My project is mainly a website called Iscream because Iscream has the word “Scream” in it which relates to voice, and because Iscream sounds like my favourite food – icecream.  
The first part would be the radio page which is a web radio filter that allows users to set the player to switch to a particular channel at a specific time of the day. For instance, assume Jane likes to listen to radio station 1003 because of the Chinese songs played but she does not like the story telling session from 9am to 10am. Using my web radio filter, Jane can set the player to another radio station such as 933 at 9am. At the same time, she can set the player to switch back to 1003 at 10am. After confirming these preferences, the player will automatically play the radio programmes of the specified radio station at the specific timings. 
To make this website, I mainly used Hyper Text Marked-up Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and Javascript. As a business student with limited coding knowledge, although the codes I used in these three files were rather basic, it still took me a long time to come up with a functioning player that switches stations automatically. 

Referring to Code Academy which we were taught to use in week 5 tutorial,  crafting the HTML code required me to bear in mind certain rules such as including an opening tag. The HTML will have a “head” and a “body”. Usually what is part of “head” cannot be seen unlike the “body” section of the HTML. I thus mainly used the “head” section to link my HTML file to my CSS file and my Javascript file. 
My CSS file was used to set the design of the site in terms of font, size, and also background image. 
Before imputing the background image via codes into the CSS file, I used Adobe Photoshop to create a background photo. To do this, I applied the lesson learnt from one of our classmates during the tutorial workshop session. The classmate taught us how to use the Quick Selection tool to cut out objects which was what I did as seen in the following picture

Applying the lessons learnt in Code Academy flexibly, by referring to the way to display a video on a website, I tweaked the method slightly to come up with a music player to play the radio tracks. As the radio tracks were audio files, when finding these sources online through the inspect segment in Chrome, I identified links that ended with MP3 or AAC and extracted them, similar to how in the Code Academy tutorial, we learnt to manage video sources by looking out for MP4 files. 
After finding the sources for the radio tracks, I created three dropdown lists for users to select the radio station and timing from.
